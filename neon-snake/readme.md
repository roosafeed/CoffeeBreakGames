# Neon Snake

A simple, retro-styled browser game where you control a neon snake to eat glowing food and grow as long as possible. Built with TypeScript and CSS Grid—no heavy frameworks required.

## Play Online
- https://roosafeed.github.io/CoffeeBreakGames/neon-snake/

## Features
- **Classic Snake gameplay**: Move the snake to eat food, grow longer, and increase your score
- **Neon aesthetic**: Glowing visuals with CSS effects
- **Score and high score**: Track your current score and best score
- **Keyboard controls**: Simple arrow key movement with Space to start/pause
- **Responsive grid**: Automatically adjusts to screen size (on page load)

## Controls
- **Start / Pause**: Space bar
- **Move**: Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)

## Tech Stack
- **TypeScript** (compiled to ES modules)
- **CSS Grid** for rendering the game board
- **Vanilla JS modules** (no bundler at runtime)
- **Simple event listeners** for UI and state updates

## Project Structure
```
neon-snake/
├─ index.html            # Game page (loads dist/main.js)
├─ styles/
│  └─ main.css           # Neon theme and grid styling
├─ src/
│  ├─ main.ts            # Game loop, input handling, collisions
│  ├─ models/            # Snake, Food, SnakeTile, GameState
│  └─ ui.ts              # UI functions for drawing board, snake, food, scores
├─ dist/                 # Compiled JS output (generated by tsc)
├─ package.json
└─ tsconfig.json
```

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (for TypeScript compiler)
- A static HTTP server (recommended):
  - VS Code Live Server extension, or
  - `npx http-server` / `npx serve`

### Install & Build
```bash
# From repository root or this folder
cd neon-snake
npm install
npm run build   # outputs to ./dist
```

### Run Locally
Because ES modules often don’t load via file://, serve over HTTP.
```bash
# Option 1: Using http-server
npx http-server . -c-1 -p 5173
# then open the URL printed by the server (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5173)

# Option 2: VS Code Live Server
# Right-click index.html and choose "Open with Live Server"
```

### Develop (Watch Mode)
```bash
npm run watch  # recompile TS on save
# Keep your HTTP server running for auto-reload
```

## How It Works
- **Game loop**: `requestAnimationFrame` updates snake position, checks for food collisions, and renders entities
- **Snake movement**: Snake moves in four directions; eats food to grow and increase score
- **Collisions**: Checks for food eating; TODO: implement self-collision detection
- **State & UI**: `GameState` manages score and high score, updated via event listeners

## Notes
- The `tsconfig.json` uses `"moduleResolution": "bundler"`. Imports include `.js` extensions to work in browsers after TypeScript compiles to `dist/`.
- Game board is dynamically sized based on screen dimensions.

## Roadmap / Ideas
- Self-collision detection for game over
- Sound effects and animations
- Persistent high scores across sessions
- Global leaderboard

I might not even spend time on these features if I ever get around to it. Feel free to contribute!
